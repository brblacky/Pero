# F.A.Q


## Users questions

### Why don't the welcome messages get sent?

You can configure welcome messages with `*welcome` and goodbye messages with `*goodbye`. If the welcome and/or goodbye messages don't get sent, type `*conf` to see your server configuration. Check that Atlanta has the permissions to send messages \(and images if you have them enabled\). If all this is done and the message still doesn't get sent, contact support!

### How does auto-moderation work?

Auto moderation automatically removes Discord invitations. This prevents members from promoting their server in the chat. If you have a salon dedicated to advertising, you have the possibility to disable auto moderation: `*automod off #channel`.

### The bot does not respond after sending a command

Check that the bot has the permissions to send messages and try again.
If it still doesn't work, it's a bug, join the [support server](https://discord.atlanta-bot.fr)!
